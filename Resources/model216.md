This dataset provides a comprehensive mapping between Reuters Instrument Codes (RICs) and Bloomberg Identifiers (BBIDs), facilitating cross-platform security identification. It enables users to link securities across Bloomberg and Reuters data sources, supporting data integration, portfolio management, and research workflows. While not directly predictive of price movements, accurate identifier mapping is essential for consolidating datasets, ensuring data integrity, and enabling robust analysis when combining information from multiple vendors. This mapping is particularly useful for quantitative analysts and portfolio managers who require seamless access to multi-source financial data.
