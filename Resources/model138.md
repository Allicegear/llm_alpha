This dataset contains a comprehensive suite of Performance Deviation Index (PDI) factors derived from 14 key accounting variables, designed to measure the deviation of a company's latest financial metrics from its historical averages. The dataset includes composite models, quality-focused variants, and sector-neutralized signals, all constructed using advanced techniques such as risk parity weighting, deseasonalization, and clustering. By capturing anomalies and behavioral biases in financial statement data, these factors have demonstrated superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional accounting ratios and growth metrics. The dataset is valuable for quantitative investors seeking to enhance stock selection, improve portfolio diversification, and boost predictive power for price movements across global equity markets.
