This dataset provides comprehensive analytics on news items related to equities, including over 80 fields across five key categories: relevance, sentiment, novelty, volume, and headline classification. Each news item is processed to generate asset-specific scores, such as sentiment (positive, neutral, negative), relevance to the asset, and measures of news novelty and volume over various time windows. The dataset also includes metadata like headline tags, company identifiers, and timestamps. By quantifying the tone, frequency, and uniqueness of news coverage for each company, this dataset enables researchers and quantitative investors to systematically incorporate real-time and historical news sentiment into trading strategies. It is particularly useful for predicting short-term price movements, identifying momentum or reversal signals, and enhancing alpha models with alternative data reflecting market perception and information flow.
