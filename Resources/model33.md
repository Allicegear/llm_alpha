This dataset provides advanced revenue estimate metrics for publicly traded companies, leveraging a proprietary SmartEstimate model that aims to improve upon traditional analyst consensus forecasts. It includes SmartEstimate values for revenue across multiple fiscal periods (current and next fiscal years, quarters, and forward 12 months), the number of contributing analysts, and predicted surprise percentages that quantify the expected deviation from consensus. By highlighting where SmartEstimates diverge from consensus, the dataset helps identify potential earnings surprises, which are often catalysts for significant price movements. This information is valuable for quantitative researchers and portfolio managers seeking to anticipate market reactions to upcoming earnings announcements and to enhance predictive models for stock price forecasting.
