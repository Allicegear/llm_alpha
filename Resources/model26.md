This dataset provides a comprehensive mapping between Bloomberg IDs (BBIDs) and Reuters Instrument Codes (RICs), facilitating cross-platform security identification and integration. It is essential for linking and harmonizing data from Bloomberg and Reuters sources, enabling seamless data aggregation, analysis, and reconciliation across different financial systems. While not directly predictive of price movements, accurate identifier mapping is crucial for ensuring data integrity in multi-source quantitative research, portfolio management, and trading operations.
