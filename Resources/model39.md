This dataset integrates two advanced quantitative models: an earnings quality model that ranks stocks based on the sustainability and reliability of their reported earnings, and an analyst revisions model that tracks changes in analyst sentiment and estimate revisions. The earnings quality component uses a multi-factor approach, considering accruals, cash flow, operating efficiency, and exclusions to assess the likelihood that a company's earnings will persist. The analyst revisions component evaluates the direction and magnitude of recent analyst estimate changes, which have historically been strong predictors of future price movements. By combining these perspectives, the dataset provides percentile rankings (1-100) for stocks globally, enabling investors to identify companies with both robust, sustainable earnings and positive analyst sentiment. This dual approach is highly effective for predicting price movements, as it captures both fundamental strength and market expectations, making it valuable for quantitative managers, stock screeners, and alpha-seeking strategies.

Abstract:
This paper sheds light on the similarities and differences with respect to the presence of anomalies in the China A-share market and other markets. To this end, we examine the existence of 32 anomalies in the China A-share market over the period 2000-2019. We find that value, risk, and trading anomalies carry over to China A-shares. Evidence for anomalies in the size, quality, and past return categories is substantially weaker, with the exception of a strong residual momentum and reversal effect. We document that most anomalies cannot be explained by industry composition, and are present among large, mid, and small capitalization stocks. We are the first to examine the existence of residual reversal, return seasonalities, and connected firm momentum for the China A-share market. We find strong out-of-sample evidence for the former two, but not the latter. Specific characteristics of the China A-share market, such as short-sale restrictions, the prevalence of state-owned enterprises, and the effect of stock market reforms, are examined in more detail. These features do not seem to be important drivers of our empirical findings.
