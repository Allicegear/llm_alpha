The FactSet Fundamental dataset provides comprehensive annual and interim financial statement data, ratios, and per-share metrics for global equities, with coverage starting from 1980 for developed markets and the 1990s for emerging markets. The dataset includes restated data from 2004 onward, ensuring historical accuracy and comparability. Key fields cover balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow items, as well as detailed breakdowns of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses, and key performance indicators. FactSet’s symbology enables robust cross-referencing with other datasets. This dataset is valuable for quantitative and fundamental analysis, backtesting, and model development, as it allows researchers to track company financial health, valuation, and performance over time, supporting predictive modeling of price movements based on changes in core financial metrics.

Abstract:
This paper sheds light on the similarities and differences with respect to the presence of anomalies in the China A-share market and other markets. To this end, we examine the existence of 32 anomalies in the China A-share market over the period 2000-2019. We find that value, risk, and trading anomalies carry over to China A-shares. Evidence for anomalies in the size, quality, and past return categories is substantially weaker, with the exception of a strong residual momentum and reversal effect. We document that most anomalies cannot be explained by industry composition, and are present among large, mid, and small capitalization stocks. We are the first to examine the existence of residual reversal, return seasonalities, and connected firm momentum for the China A-share market. We find strong out-of-sample evidence for the former two, but not the latter. Specific characteristics of the China A-share market, such as short-sale restrictions, the prevalence of state-owned enterprises, and the effect of stock market reforms, are examined in more detail. These features do not seem to be important drivers of our empirical findings.

2.@Unintended Impact of Academic Research.pdf.

Abstract:
This paper explores a channel whereby asset-pricing anomalies can appear as investors alter portfolios according to findings in academic research. In particular, I find that assets with low realized CAPM Alphas outperform those with high ones, but this finding only appears after the CAPM’s publication in the 1960s. I find evidence consistent with the widespread application of the CAPM model generating incentives to tilt portfolios systematically away from low CAPM Alpha assets, causing such assets to be undervalued.
