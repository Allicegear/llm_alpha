This dataset provides a comprehensive mapping between Reuters Instrument Codes (RICs) and Bloomberg IDs for securities across global markets. By linking these two widely used security identifiers, the dataset enables seamless integration and cross-referencing of data from different financial data providers. This mapping is essential for portfolio managers, analysts, and quantitative researchers who need to consolidate, validate, or enrich datasets from multiple sources. While not directly predictive of price movements, accurate identifier mapping is a foundational tool for building robust multi-source analytics, backtesting strategies, and ensuring data consistency in quantitative models.
