This dataset provides comprehensive, algorithmically generated ratings and evaluations for over 6,000 equities and 15,000 funds worldwide. It aggregates and processes fundamental, technical, and projected criteria to produce objective scores on upside potential and risk, including metrics such as earnings revision trends, price potential, medium-term technical trends, and relative performance. Additionally, it offers risk assessments based on historical bear market and bad news sensitivity. The multi-factor approach enables investors and researchers to identify stocks with strong growth prospects, favorable technical momentum, and manageable risk, making it a valuable resource for predicting price movements and constructing robust investment strategies.

Abstract :
Currency shocks affect future corporate earnings: companies exporting in countries with an appreciating currency see their earnings increase. Using company-level data on geographic sales, we document that analysts fail to fully integrate currency shocks into their firm-level forecasts: their forecast errors can therefore be predicted by past currency movements. We also show that stock prices do not respond immediately to currency shocks: prices take about two weeks to integrate them. This is true for small to medium size shocks but not for larger shocks, in line with a bounded rationality interpretation. Finally, we find some evidence that arbitrage capital exploiting this anomaly has increased in recent years.

Abstract :
In the run-up to the ex-dividend day a measure based on option implied dividends predicts ex-day abnormal stock returns. These expected ex-dividend day returns increase on stocks where it is less worthwhile to capture the dividend, stocks that are less liquid, stocks with high idiosyncratic risk, and stocks that have experienced a build-up in selling pressure. The evidence from the options markets suggests the positive abnormal ex-day returns, net of transactions costs, achieved by institutions skilled in trading are a risk premium for their role in providing liquidity to non-informational stock traders.

3.@Factor Momentum Everywhere.pdf

Abstract :
In this article, the authors document robust momentum behavior in a large collection of 65 widely studied characteristic-based equity factors around the globe. They show that, in general, individual factors can be reliably timed based on their own recent performance. A time series “factor momentum” portfolio that combines timing strategies of all factors earns an annual Sharpe ratio of 0.84. Factor momentum adds significant incremental performance to investment strategies that employ traditional momentum, industry momentum, value, and other commonly studied factors. Their results demonstrate that the momentum phenomenon is driven in large part by persistence in common return factors and not solely by persistence in idiosyncratic stock performance.
