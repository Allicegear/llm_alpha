# How to get a higher Sharpe

Often there is no best answer for this general question, so we would suggest you first need to understand the Sharpe or the related metric, information ratio (IR).
- IR = Return / standard_deviation (Return)

Based on this formula, there are two ways to improve IR:
1. Increase your alpha return
2. Reduce your volatility

## Increase your alpha return
If you think of alpha as a prediction of the return, then increasing the return often means you are predicting the return better. In other words, the more information you have, the better your prediction. You can predict short term with price–volume data or news and long term with fundamental, analyst or news data, just to name a few possibilities. A simple prediction model is often more robust, but the performance may be low, while a more complex model will often generate a higher return, but beware of overfitting

## Reduce your Volatility
To reduce your volatility you may want to understand where it comes from: One way is to think about the instability of a stock and the market. Neutralization can often help reduce the exposure to the overall market or a certain group within it with high volatility.
