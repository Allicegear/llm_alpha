The transition you make from being a user to a consultant is not straightforward since you will work on many open-ended problems in the process of making alphas. There are no right or wrong answers in the alpha-making process since quant research is a mixture of creative and scientific thinking.

Typically, the alpha research cycle is comprised of 3 stages:

Coming up with an intuitive alpha idea;
Implementing it using the available datasets and operators; and
Optimizing the parameters and neutralization settings of the alpha in order to submit it in its best form.
While the alpha idea, datasets and operators keep changing, the techniques and methodologies needed to achieve the three remain largely the same. Hence, the following posts are a generic guide for your alpha research journey and will act as solid foundations for you:

How to get a higher Sharpe.md

How to potentially increase returns of an alpha.md

How to reduce correlation of an alpha.md

How to reduce turnover.md

How to potentially decrease PnL fluctuations.md

How to gain intuition for Neutralization.md

How to avoid overfitting.md

These readings answer some of the most common problems faced during the process of making alphas. Incorporating the practices suggested above should assist you in your journey with WorldQuant Brain, and may lead to significantly better results in the long run.
