We have to accept the fact that fitting is a part of the alpha creation process. As a result, overfitting is also part of the game. The most important way to control for overfitting is by doing disciplined research.


Is overfitting bad? Yes, it is. However, random data mining research without ideas is even worse. Robust alphas require good ideas and rigorous testing. Here are some of the tests you can use to reduce the chance for overfitting and improve the robustness of your alphas.

Rank test (turn alpha to rank)
Binary test (turn alpha to -1, 1)
Sub/super universe test
Don’t limit yourself to what is listed here. There are tests that can be done based on your creativity and experience; the more you do the better. By the way, random backtest is often not very applicable due to changing market conditions.

Here are some other tips and tricks:

Often it is not a good idea to concentrate weight on volatile stocks.
Reduce your exposure to factors.
Don’t choose the best; the second best often has less overfitting tendency.
Don’t fit tests. No test is bad. Fitting to tests is also bad.
Don’t select. If you have to choose between using 4 or 6-day decays, you can use 5 or simply take the alpha average of 4 and 6 days.
Don’t fail in to the excellent/superior trap. What you see based on IS performance. The main question is, “Can that performance hold?”
Be courteous to other people and share ideas and good advice.
Using the test period feature in settings to prevent overfitting:

Using simulation settings, you can divide your In-Sample (IS) period into a Train and Test period. The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them. An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of Training Period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.
