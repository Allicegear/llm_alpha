Double Neutralization

You can apply simultaneous neutralizations by two different groups, such as country and industry with the help of "group_cartesian_product", in regions with many countries like EUR, ASI, and GLB. Double neutralization neutralizes Alphas within a group of stocks that share the same 'country' and 'industry' identifiers. In the USA, we can use other pairs, such as combinations from industry/subindustry/sector and another group (for example, sector, sta1_top1000c50).

If you use two "group_neutralize" operators sequentially, such as group_neutralize(group_neutralize(Alpha, industry), country), the second neutralization partially negates the first one. The double neutralization approach differs from using two group_neutralize operators.

ASI Example: Double neutralization by industry and country
Original Alpha: ts_rank(eps, 252)

Set Neutralization=Sector: In settings, set Universe=MINVOL1M

Double Neutralization Alpha:

alpha = ts_rank(eps, 252) group = densify(group_cartesian_product(industry, country)) group_neutralize(alpha, group)

Line 2 uses group_cartesian_product to merge industry and country into a new group. This ensures unique values for each pair of industry and country

USA Example: Double neutralization by sector and other grouping
Original Alpha: group_rank(ts_rank(eps, 252), sector)

Set Neutralization=Sector: In settings, set Universe=TOP1000

Double Neutralization Alpha:

group = group_cartesian_product(sector, sta1_top1000c50) alpha = group_rank(ts_rank(eps, 252), group) group_neutralize(alpha, group)

Line 1 uses group_cartesian_product to merge sta1_top1000c50 with the sector grouping. This ensures that all group operators in the Alpha consider both sector and statistical grouping.

Tips for Success
Using basic grouping fields in 'double neutralization' for the multi-country region can improve an Alpha’s simulated performance.
Try using other grouping datasets for 'double neutralization' in the USA/EUR/ASI regions to improve an Alpha’s simulated performance
