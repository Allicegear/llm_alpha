# Some ideas using ***price-volume*** data:

1. ***Momentum***
    - Following price trend
    - To participate in momentum investing, one would take a long position in an asset that has shown an upward-trending price, or short-sell a security that has been in a downtrend.
    - The basic idea is that once a trend is established, it is more likely to continue in that direction than to move against the trend.
2. ***Reversal or reversion***
    - A reversal is a change in the direction of a price trend, which can be a positive or negative change against the prevailing trend.
    - On a price chart, reversals undergo a recognizable change in the price structure. A reversal is also referred to as a “trend reversal” or a “correction.”
3. ***Breakout & Volume spike***
    - Using technical indicators to predict whether the upcoming trend is whether momentum or reversal. 
    - Breakout: Buy a stock when its price moves above a resistance level, or sell when it falls below a support level, with the expectation that the price will continue moving in that direction.
    - Volume Spike: Monitor for significant increases in trading volume, as these spikes can indicate the beginning of a new trend or a potential reversal.
