# Tips for getting started with ***Macro*** Datasets:
-The macro data category encompasses diverse datasets covering macroeconomic research, job market analytics, technical stock ratings, and more. It enables the identification of economic trends, shifts in market sentiment, and assessments of companies' financial stability.
- Macro data on US economic indicators or interest rates can be an excellent indicator to detect market regimes, helping to determine whether the economy is in a phase of expansion or contraction.

# Example Alpha Ideas:
1. During economic expansion, going long on cyclical stocks identified by high beta or high earnings volatility can be advantageous, while defensive stocks may be more favorable during economic contraction.
2. Company expansion can be a positive indicator of financial health. Consider going long on stocks of companies that have recently increased their job postings compared to their peers in the same industry.
