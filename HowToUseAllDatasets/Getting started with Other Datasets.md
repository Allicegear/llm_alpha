# Tips for getting started with ***Other*** Datasets:

- The "Other" category contains datasets from various sources, including NLP-based data, company relationships, equity flow information, and more.
- ***NLP (Natural Language Processing)***: NLP uses algorithms and computational techniques to analyze and interpret human language. In finance, it extracts insights from news articles, earnings reports, social media, and other text-based data sources. NLP is useful for gauging market sentiment, identifying emerging trends, and detecting potential risks or opportunities by processing large volumes of textual data.
- ***Company Relationships***: This category involves understanding the connections and interactions between companies, such as supply chain relationships, partnerships, and competitive dynamics.
- ***Equity Flow***: Equity flow refers to the movement of capital into and out of stocks, including metrics such as net inflows and outflows, trading volume, institutional activity, and ETF flows. Monitoring equity flow helps investors understand market sentiment, track trends, and identify potential buying or selling opportunities based on fund movements in the market.

# Example Alpha ideas:

- Positive sentiment in earnings calls often indicates strong future performance, while negative sentiment can signal potential downturns. Use oth384_presentation_negnum and oth384_presentation_posnum to capture sentiment information in conference call conversations.
- Institutional investors have the resources and insights to detect emerging opportunities and risks. By tracking their activities via equity flows, you can identify stocks gaining institutional interest. Use oth17_fmdscore1, oth17_fmdscore2, and oth17_fmdscore3 data fields to identify stocks with strong inflows.
