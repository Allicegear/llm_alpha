# Tips for getting started with ***Earnings*** Datasets:

- The 'Earnings' data category provides information on company performance and market expectations, including analyst estimates vs. actual earnings, financial report timings, and corporate event schedules.
- Backfilling with ts_backfill() may be necessary due to irregular reporting dates across different companies.
- The data category primarily includes fields linked to a company's fundamental data reporting, often associated with lower turnover.

# Example Alpha Ideas:

- Companies that report earnings higher than what analysts have predicted typically see a surge in their stock prices. Investors can buy these stocks before the market has fully priced in the information.
- Capitalize on the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) effect by going long on stocks that have high Standardized Unexpected Earnings and positive Earnings Announcement Return, indicating a strong positive response to earnings announcement.
- After a company announces disappointing earnings, its stock price often drops. However, these drops can sometimes be overreactions, and the stock may rebound in the future.
