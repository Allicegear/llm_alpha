Sentiment1 dataset
Getting Started with sentiment1 dataset (Research Sentiment Data)

The sentiment1 dataset combines sentiment metrics with earnings estimations and surprises for U.S.-listed companies.
It provides insights into market mood, analyst consensus, and earnings-based signals.
Key fields include sentiment scores, ratios of analyst buy/sell recommendations, earnings surprises, and dispersion among analyst estimates.
Sentiment scores are dynamic with higher turnover in nature, while analyst and earnings metrics are slower-moving signals.
Use smoothing decay operations to manage high-frequency sentiment data and be considerate when using long lookback periods (>63 days) as older events may lose relevance.
The dataset has coverage of approximately 2000 on TOP3000. Do try your ideas on more liquid universes such as TOP1000 and TOPSP500 but ensure sufficient long & short count to avoid overfitting.
