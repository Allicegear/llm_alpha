# Tips for getting started with ***Social Media*** Datasets:

- Social media data are based on information from newspapers, news websites, Facebook, Twitter, blog posts, discussion groups, and forums.
- The data provide social sentiment as well as sentiment volume for different stocks.
- Social sentiment indicators help investors identify information in social media that could cause a stock's price to increase or decrease in the near future.
- Unlike fundamental data, these data naturally have high frequencies, which can lead to high turnovers in an alpha**.**
- To achieve reasonable margin rates, consider using the following operations: hump_decay, ts_decay_linear, and ts_decay_exp_window. However, be careful when using lookback periods greater than 63 days (i.e., one quarter) as older events may have no impact.

# Example Alpha Ideas:

- Long / short stocks with positive / negative sentiment, filtering out days and stocks with low sentiment volume.
- Use sentiment volume as a proxy for market's attention to a stock. This could be used directly as a stock returns predictor or a condition in trade_when.
- For vector data fields, experiment with other vector operators like vec_max, vec_min, or vec_range to retrieve different information from the vector data rather than simply using vec_avg.
